# Shapes and Perimeters

## Specifications

*(optional)*
**Concrete Class Implementation**
1. Using package `com.company.concreteapproach`, create a basic class called `Shape`.  Include properties for name, color, x coordinate, and y coordinate. Also provide an empty implementation for `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.
1. Once you have the `Shape` class created, create the below classes. Each class will inherit from the `Shape` class. Each should have properties appropriate to them, and an implementation for `area()` and `perimeter()`.
    - `Circle`
    - `Square`
    - `Triangle`

*(optional)*
**Abstract Class Implementation**
1. Using package `com.company.abstractapproach`, create an abstract class called `Shape`.  Include the same basic properties as before, but this time, declare the the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods as `abstract`.
1. Again, create the `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes, inheriting from the new abstract `Shape` class.

*(optional)*
**Interface Implementation**
1. Examine the starter code found in package `com.company.interfaceapproach`.  This is the same implementation that we previously created in our lesson on interfaces.

*(REQUIRED)*
**Written Response**
1. In your own words, write a few paragraphs comparing and contrasting these approaches. Which implementation is "best?" Feel free to create an `main` method and test out each, if you feel that helps your understanding.
